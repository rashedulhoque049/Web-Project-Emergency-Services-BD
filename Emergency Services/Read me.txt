Project Name: Emergency Services BD

Tools Used:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, 
Backend: PHP, JavaScript
Database: PhpMyAdmin

Description:

I have developed a website (Search Engine) with an admin panel where any user can search for nearest location of emergency Services like Nearest Hospital, Emergency Ambulance, Police Station, Fire Services etc just by searching their location. User will get basic information like, address, phone number, direction from google map etc. Also any user can contribute for the site by adding information into database but that will require admin verification, once admin validate/reject the info, it will be added/removed from the main database.

For example: If an user search for  Nearest Hospital at "gulshan", he/she will get a list of hospitals at gulshan, search results will be fetched from database. Also any user can contribute by adding any service, i.e. hospital name, address, phone number, direction in our database but that will need admin validation before its added to the main database.
